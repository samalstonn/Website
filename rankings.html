      <p class="under">Here are the results for the Varsity Race at the Eastern Sprints
        Championship. Looks like I did a pretty good job! Rowing races,
        especially lightweight rowing races can be very hard to predict.
        There are many factors I can't include, such as injuries and substitutions.
        However, I look forward to improving my analysis next year!

    <div class="project-description">
      <p class="rankings-font"> I devised this project to analyze collegiate rowing races in the regular
        season and predict their results in the championship season. In the regular
        season, all teams do not race each other so I wanted to see if I could
        predict how each team would do. First, I took, results from row2k.com
        (shown below). Next, I turned the races into a .txt file and compared
        each team with multiple different ranking systems to get a composite result.
        I factored in the conditions around racing to the results such as wind-speed,
        recency of the race, home team advantage etc. I sorted the teams based on
        average margin, total margin, and even re-ran the races again with an initial
        ranking to give stronger/weaker teams more or less weight! Scroll down to
        see how I did.
